                What is branding?

            <p class="description-paragrap-boody text-center" id="para-1">
                Branding is the marketing practice of actively shaping your brand. That’s the basic definition, but
                there is so much more that goes into it. Branding is what your business needs to break through the
                clutter and grab your ideal customer’s attention. It’s what transforms first-time buyers into lifetime
                customers and turns an indifferent audience into brand evangelists. It’s what you need to stand out,
                make an impact and take your business to the next level. In other words, if you want your business to
                succeed, branding is non-negotiable. But why, exactly, is branding so important? What does it entail?
                And how do you brand your business in a way that’s going to have a real impact on your audience? In this
                article, we’re going to explore what branding is and how your business can reap its benefits in the most
                effective way.

                Why is branding so important?
            </h1>

            <p class="description-paragrap-boody text-center" id="para-2">
                Helps you stand out from the competition. It doesn’t matter what kind of company you have, what industry
                you’re in, or what type of customer you’re after—if you’re in business, you’ve got some serious
                competition. Branding helps you establish the ways in which you’re different, special, and unique. And
                it shows your customers why they should work with you instead of your competitors.

                Builds brand recognition. If you want to build a successful brand, you need to be recognizable. The
                right branding (including designing an impactful logo, website, and other brand assets) helps you carve
                out a distinct style, and it increases your brand recognition in the market.

                Creates a consistent brand experience for your customers. In order for your business to succeed, you
                need to provide a consistent experience for your customers however they interact with your brand—whether
                that’s through your website, at an in-person event or by following your social media accounts. Branding
                allows you to control how people perceive and experience your brand—and you can ensure that perception
                and experience stays consistent across all your brand touchstones.

                Sparks a connection with your audience and turns that audience into loyal customers. The most successful
                businesses are the ones that foster an emotional connection with their audience. That emotional
                connection is what transforms a prospect into a customer and a customer into a brand enthusiast. And how
                do you create and build that connection? Branding. Different branding strategies (like packing an
                emotional punch with your brand voice or leveraging color psychology when designing your logo) can help
                you connect with your audience on a deeper level and create a sense of loyalty to your brand.

            <h1 class="description-paragrap text-justify">
                What are the elements of branding?
            </h1>

            <p class="description-paragrap-boody text-center" id="para-3">
                Mission statement and brand values. Your mission statement and brand values are the foundation for your
                branding. Think of your mission as the brains of the operation—a short and succinct statement that
                defines the present state and purpose of your organization. Meanwhile, your company’s vision is its
                heart, providing an inspirational and motivational snapshot of what you seek to achieve in the long
                term.

                Brand guidelines. With the mission and vision statement set as the pillars of your organization, your
                brand strategy comes to encompass everything in between. This will take the form of brand guidelines
                (also known as your “brand bible”). These guidelines are comprised into a tangible document that will
                reflect and support your business goals, differentiate you from competitors, resonate with customers,
                provide a template for decision-making and precipitate ideas for future marketing campaigns. It will
                also include all the stylistic elements of your branding, including your color palette, fonts, and an
                outline of your brand voice.

                Logo. Your logo is the face of your company and designing your logo is arguably the single most
                important branding you’ll do for your business. During the design process, think about who you are as a
                brand and how you want to be perceived by your customers. Use that to drive your design strategy.

                Website. Designing your website is also a key branding step. Your website is your brand’s digital real
                estate and when your customers visit, it should be visually engaging, easy to use, and most important of
                all a reflection of who you are as a brand. Similar to your logo, refer to your brand guide to choose
                your web design elements (like layout and fonts).

                Additional assets. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to branding. Depending on your business and
                industry, you might need additional assets like business cards, product packaging or event flyers.
                Assess your business and your unique needs, and then develop additional branding assets accordingly.

                A better brand means better marketing

            <p class="description-paragrap-boody text-center" id="para-4">

                As a general rule, products have limited life cycles, but brands—if managed well—last forever. And once
                you’ve nailed down exactly who you are as a brand, it becomes much easier to market it. Your brand
                guidelines, coupled with ongoing market research and analysis, should give you a tactical advantage in
                determining the best way to market your products. Do you focus on traditional marketing like radio and
                billboard, or is your potential customer more swayed by viral Youtube videos and Snapchat filters?
                Marketing can be a mix and match of tactics, but be careful of spreading yourself too thin. By
                continually consulting your brand guide, you should be able to focus your efforts on the tactics that
                really matter. At the end of the day, marketing is the process that brings you the leads and sales, but
                branding is the foundation upon which you build your reputation and customer loyalty.

                The one thing you’ll want to remember is that branding is a verb. It is an action. So while it might

                unforgettable brand—it is also empowering. Rather than letting others tell your story, you are speaking
                up with branding. If you ever feel lost in the process, remember that support is always at hand. Once
                you have established your branding vision, get in touch with a professional designer help to bring your
